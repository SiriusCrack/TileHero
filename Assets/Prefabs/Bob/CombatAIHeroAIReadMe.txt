Prefab Name: CombatAI, HeroAI

Summary:
Provides the healthbar and allows it to update the display and follow the hero. Also, has combat movement.

Use: 
Must be attached to an NPC. Please note that while the Hero can accept the CombatAI and the game will run, combat looks smoother if you use the HeroAI instead. This is the only change between them currently. You must also add the healthbar to both the health bar and health bar slider.

Components:
CombatAI (Script) - The script. Please read the comments in the script if you have questions.

TroubleShooting:
There can be strange occurences when it comes to the movement or the health bar not tracking correctly. I would reccomend running the program twice before changing the code as sometimes strange bugs occur that do not happen twice. If the problem persists. Everything is in short functions, so troubleshooting should be simple.
