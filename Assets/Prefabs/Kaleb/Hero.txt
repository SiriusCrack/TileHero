Name: Hero
Summary: A simple hero class and sprite, sprite is basic pill
         Includes health, interface for a weapon, as well as fully automatic, direction based movement

Description: 
    Interfaces- health, attack, attack timing, weapon, effects (bleed, poison, buff), Inventory, a Combat AI, the next direction,
                the current enemy, as well as a list of current engaged enemies.
    
    Integration- simply drag the hero to the current scene. Feed the hero directions theough a manager object.

    Troubleshooting- 
                I cant make the hero interact with the environment- make sure the other environment pieces have box colliders
                I want to change how much it moves- to do this change the value in all the while loops in the Move function 
                I want to move a variable amount- the hero does not support this out of the box, try using movement on a small distance
                                        multiple times in a row
