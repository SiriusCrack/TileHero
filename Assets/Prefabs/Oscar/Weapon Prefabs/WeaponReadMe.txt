Name: Weapon
Summary: A simple weapon script, and a sprite renderer of a weapon
         
Description: 
    Interfaces- attack speed, attack damage, attack range, effect, and effect type
    
    Integration- Add the weapon to the scene, place the weapon inside either the hero or enemy 
                 prefab which will then give that npc a weapon. You can drag an effect into the 
                 weapon to give it that effect.

    Troubleshooting- 
                Weapon variables such as damage, speed, range can all be changed inside their 
                respective scripts.
